# Modal_AddEventListener

If we want to use same function in multiple adEventListener, we can simply create a separate function and store it in a variable.
After that we will pass that function as an arugement to the addEventListener parameter.
add and remove classList helps very much to manipulate multiple css function without creating multiple css class.
